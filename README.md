# invisitactoe

A flutter TicTacToe application with a catch. The tiles vanish after you make your move so you will have to remember the board state. Making an invalid move will cost you a turn. 
There are two playable modes. One is a 2 player mode where you can play both sides. There is also a Bot mode where you play against an AI that runs on the Minimax algorithm. The bot plays the game optimally so a win is impossible.
